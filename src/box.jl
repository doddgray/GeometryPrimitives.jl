export Box

# Below, the box axes describe the directions of edges.  For example, if a₁, a₂, a₃ are the
# axes of a 3D box, then the volume inside the box is the collection of points x₁a₁ + x₂a₂
# + x₃a₃, where -rₙ ≤ xₙ ≤ rₙ.  This means aₙ and aₘ with n ≠ m span a face of the box.
#
# The box projection matrix (Box.p) is the matrix that produces the coordinates (x₁, x₂, x₃)
# of a given point.  In other words, for a point x inside the box, the nth entry of Box.p * x
# must have magnitude ≤ rₙ.  This means that Box.p * aₙ = eₙ, because aₙ has only the aₙ-component
# and the component must be 1.  This also means that each row of Box.p is orthogononal to
# two box axes, and therefore normal to the face spanned by the two box axes.  (Note that
# the rows of Box.p are not unit normals to the faces, becuase they are not unit vectors.)
